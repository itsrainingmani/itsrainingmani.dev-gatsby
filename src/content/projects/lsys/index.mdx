**_lsys_** is an interactive Fractal Generator.

I came upon a wonderful article on generating fractals using a set of rules known as the Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) and after reading it, I was inspired to make a website that would allow people to generate their own Fractals.

This website was built using <XA href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</XA>.
