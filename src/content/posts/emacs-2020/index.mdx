<section class="blog-section">

Well it's been almost a year since I "started" this blog and to be honest, I can't say that it's been off to a very good start.

The last year has been stressful in many different ways, personally and professionally. I've changed jobs, struggled with understanding what I want to do with my career and tried to come to terms with reality.

But scratch all that. It's time to talk about Emacs.

Thousands of people have probably started off blog posts that way. And with good reason. Emacs has plenty of material that is worth talking about.

And darn it if I'm going to let a well-trodden road discourage me from putting my own thoughts out there.

So. Emacs in 2020. I've been having flashes of inspiration to learn a Lisp for a while now. There's just something ... *intriguing* about Lisps. Especially for someone serially addicted to learning new stuff. The foreign syntax, the hushed whispers of parenthesis hell, meta-programming, macros. My very fist programming language was C++ and I cut my teeth on Java, Python and C#.

There's just something about Lisps that caught my attention.

But maybe learning a language just for those reasons isn't good enough. You have to justify it with more concrete reasons. You need to conduct a serious analysis on the pros of cons of the language, understand it's ecosystem, it's power, if any well-known companies are using it.

Or. You can just pick something that you saw on a Hacker news post once an run with it.

That's how I landed on Clojure. This is not to say that Clojure is not a good language. It is. Wait. Maybe it's too early to say for me. After all I've only been learning for a few days now.

Anyway. Once I picked Clojure, the next obvious question is what do i write Clojure code on.
