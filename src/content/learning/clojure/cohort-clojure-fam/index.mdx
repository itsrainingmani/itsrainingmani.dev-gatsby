I've been trying to make my learning process more publicly visible recently after reading <XA href="https://twitter.com/swyx">@swyx</XA>'s posts about *Learning in Public*.

I've also been dipping my toes into Clojure, Emacs & Codifying my Personal Knowledge (w/ Obsidian). Reading that tweet was like the crystallization of what I've been thinking about the last few weeks!

The follow up tweet tipped me off about a very interesting organization and learning program.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m very interested in PKM tools and Athens is building a <a href="https://twitter.com/RoamResearch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Roamresearch</a> alternative. Now, I don‚Äôt know Clojure but it&#39;s always been on my list (I played with Scheme before). So I‚Äôve enrolled in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClojureFam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ClojureFam</a>‚Äôs 3rd cohort and will be starting next Monday.</p>&mdash; adrien ‚ö° (@adrien) <a href="https://twitter.com/adrien/status/1273013238230368258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

I could learn something I'm interested in Public. Not just that but I could also engage with other Clojurians!

### Clojure Fam


<XA href="https://github.com/athensresearch">Athen's Research</XA> has many visions - A Self-hosted, Open Source Knowledge Graph; Protocols for Knowledge Representation and Building a Colloborative Learning Community.

The last vision is what I'm focusing on now. Clojure Fam is an open community that enables learners to join Cohorts and focus on learning Clojure with other like-minded people.

Each Cohort lasts for 5 weeks and the emphasis is on open communication, helping each other and holding each other accountable to what they want to achieve.

Personally, I think the idea of focused, small-groups for learning is an excellent idea. Every lab section I enjoyed in College had a similar structure. There is no one telling you what to do, or how to do something. Just a group of people trying to achieve more knowledge and insight together.

Starting today, June 22nd 2020, I will be beginning my Clojure journey anew with ClojureFam's 4th Cohort. I have high hopes that I will be able to engage constructively with my fellow learners and that being held publicly accountable to the standards I've set for myself will be a locus of motivation.

Expectations for myself:

* Weekly blog post/tweets about what I've learned.
* Completing the excellent *Clojure for the Brave and True* book
* Completing clojure-koans
* Working through Clojure exercises on 4Clojure.com
* Making one commit to Athen's Research Open Source Repo
